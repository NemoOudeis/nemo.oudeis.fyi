I haven't worked from the office since 20th of February. Most of my department in Rakuten hasn't been in the office in weeks/months, the one time I stopped by end of March to pickup a testing device and a big motinor I met about 4 people out of 70 or so, the office is a ghost town, with tumbleweeds and all. We've all adjusted our work and personal life significantly, we learned to cope as organiaztion and as individuals. These are some observations I made about myself, my team and what I heard from friends within the company -- all anecdotal evidence (as always). 

So let's dive into it - what did we learn?

* From home we work just as effective & efficient
* 9am - 5:30pm never really mattered
* We can skip most meetings
* Working on your own at home is hard
* Communication = Good Writing
* Presence != Control

All of these were true before the pandemic.
Rakuten's leadership is just a bit slow on this front.

## Being Effective & Efficient

Most of creative work does not happen in meeting rooms [^1].
Some of it does, sometimes getting together in front of a whiteboard is like magic. Recreating these moments in a remote work environment can be really difficult, even with iPad, Apple Pencil and ZOOM.
However that moment of grand ideas and stroke of genius, that happens once every quarter - at best. The rest of the time is spent on... you know, actually executing on the grand ideas. Creative execution work happens in bursts of individual work, interwoven with feedback from others. This is the work that happens outside of meetings, deep works, this requires quite & focus. This type of work fits the home office better than Rakuten Crimson House (of the before times) - if you have a desk, a monitor and protection from children.

[^1]: Jason Fried goes even further and says ["Work Doesn't Happen at Work" in his TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen_at_work/transcript?language=en)

Personally I am in a priviledged situation of: doing a lot of deep work, no kids around, decent sized apartment with desk and big montior (my chais is a bit sucky but hey, I really can't complain) and I'm more on the introvert end of the spectrum. From my personal perspective this is the most productive and efficient time I spent working at Rakuten.

In the teams I work with I see no significant shift in terms of output. I hear the same from manager within my department and in other departments as well. However I only spoke with people in technical departments, I have no idea how this affects the business-y work (which is the majority of the company).

In the last 2 months I have seen several project progress significantly, all crowned by the interal release of a waterfall-y project we have been working on for over a year now. In terms of delivery covid didn't matter, work from home didn't stop us. We had some new infrastructure problems (e.g. it's hard to restart the mac mini CI machine remotely) - but no show stoppers.

## Forgetting the 9-to-5

Rakuten is a strong believer in the strict busisness hours, at least at the start of the day. Several departments had morning meetings (朝礼) in the before times, with the whole department standing up and starting the day togther. Others have morning stadups in their teams at 9am. And some are less anal about it. However, the general rule is: be at your desk at 9 am. Be there until (at least) 5:30 pm.

Now that everyone working remotely most people actually don't need to be at their desk at 9 am, or finish work at 5:30 for that matter. If you have no meetings in the morning, nobody will notice if you start work by noon and work until 8:30 pm instead. I have a strong suspicion that many people are taking advantage of this flexibility that came as a side effect of working from home. I also suspect that nobody really notices and nobody is affected negatively by this.

Will Raktuen Leadership remember this after covid is "over"? 

## I've got so many meeting *hair toss* 

In some circles having a lot of meeting is a status symbol. More meetings = more better.

In the before times most meeting made me feel like...

And for good reason [^2]. As our CISO/CTO Hirai-san told us just this week: Meetings are good for strategic decision making. I'll add that meetings can be good for information sharing with feedback, like announcing HR changes. I'm not entirely sure about specific sprint ceremonies like grooming, review and retrospectives.... In summary:

[^2]: In the words of the [ReWork](http://rework.fm/) podcast ["Meetings Are Toxic"](https://m.signalvnoise.com/meetings-are-toxic/)

Meeting are **good** for:
: Strategic decision making
: Information sharing that requires immediate feedback/clarification

Meetings are **bad** for:
: Status updates
: Design/Code review
: Release Judgement
: Unidirectional Information sharing
: Effort estimations
: Meetings with more than 4 attendees

In my perception we have gotten much better at scheduling less unnecessary meetings, we have gotten better at compiling information ahead of time and sharing it before meetings.
