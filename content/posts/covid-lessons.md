I haven't worked from the office since 20th of February, that's a little over 2 months. Most of my department in Rakuten hasn't been in the office in weeks/months, the one time I stopped by end of March to pickup a testing device and a big monitor I met about 4 people out of 70 or so, the office is a ghost town, with tumbleweeds and all. We've all adjusted our work and personal life significantly, we learned to cope as organization and as individuals. These are some observations I made about myself, my team and what I heard from friends within the company -- all anecdotal evidence (as always). 

So let's jump right into it - what did we learn?

* From home we work just as effective & efficient
* 9am - 5:30pm never really mattered
* We can skip most meetings
* Working on your own at home is hard
* Communication = Good Writing
* Presence != Control

All of these were true before the pandemic.
Rakuten's leadership is just a bit slow on this front.

## Being Effective & Efficient

Most of creative work does not happen in meeting rooms [^1].
Some of it does, sometimes getting together in front of a whiteboard is like magic. Recreating these moments in a remote work environment can be really difficult, even with iPad, Apple Pencil and ZOOM.
However that moment of grand ideas and stroke of genius, that happens once every quarter - at best. The rest of the time is spent on... you know, actually executing on the grand ideas. Creative execution work happens in bursts of individual work, interwoven with feedback from others. This is the work that happens outside of meetings, deep works, this requires quite & focus. This type of work fits the home office better than Rakuten Crimson House (of the before times) - if you have a desk, a monitor and protection from children.

[^1]: Jason Fried goes even further and says ["Work Doesn't Happen at Work" in his TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen_at_work/transcript?language=en)

Personally I am in a privileged situation of doing a lot of deep work, no kids around, decent sized apartment with desk and big monitor. And I'm more on the introvert end of the spectrum, which helps a lot. From my perspective this is the most productive and efficient time I spent working at Rakuten.

In the teams I work with I see no significant shift in terms of output. I hear the same from managers in other departments as well as from executives. However I only spoke with people in technical departments, I wonder how this affects the business-y work, which is the majority of the company.

In the last 2 months I have seen several project progress significantly, all crowned by the internal release of a waterfall-y project we have been working on for over a year now. In terms of delivery covid didn't matter, work from home didn't stop us. We had some new infrastructure problems (e.g. it's hard to restart the mac mini CI machine remotely) - but no show stoppers.

## Forgetting the 9-to-5

Rakuten is a strong believer in the strict business hours, at least at the start of the day. Several departments had morning meetings (ÊúùÁ§º) in the before times, with the whole department standing up and starting the day together. Others have morning stand-ups in their teams at 9am. And some are less anal about it. However, the general rule is: be at your desk at 9 am. Be there until (at least) 5:30 pm.

Now that everyone working remotely most people actually don't need to be at their desk at 9 am, or finish work at 5:30 for that matter. If you have no meetings in the morning, nobody will notice if you start work by noon and work until 8:30 pm instead. I have a strong suspicion that many people are taking advantage of this flexibility that came as a side effect of working from home. I also suspect that nobody really notices and nobody is affected negatively by this.

Will Rakuten Leadership remember this after covid is "over"? 

## I've got so many meeting *hair toss* 

In some circles having a lot of meeting is a status symbol. More meetings = more better.

In the before times most meeting made me feel like...

![Man in a meeting, gets up, jumps out of window.](https://media.giphy.com/media/dUKTqZzPwTdM4/source.gif)

And for good reason [^2]. As our CIO/CISO Hirai-san told us just this week: Meetings are good for strategic decision making. I'll add that meetings can be good for information sharing with feedback, like announcing HR changes that might cause confusion or anxiety. To be honest I'm not entirely sure if specific sprint ceremonies like grooming, review and retrospectives are best facilitated as meetings... but let's give them the benefit of the doubt. So that leaves us with a short list of (potentially) good meetings:
: Strategic decision making
: Information sharing that requires immediate feedback/clarification
: Sprint ceremonies (maybe)

[^2]: In the words of the [ReWork](http://rework.fm/) podcast ["Meetings Are Toxic"](https://m.signalvnoise.com/meetings-are-toxic/)

On the other hand I can think of countless types of collaborative work that doesn't require a meeting, some example off the top of my head:
: Status updates
: Design/Code review
: Release Judgement
: Unidirectional Information sharing
: Effort estimations
: Meetings with more than 4 attendees

In this time of 100% ZOOM meetings I now don't have to restrain myself, when I find a meeting to be pointless and a waste of time I can blatantly face-palm - the difference between openly insulting behavior and indifference is just on "turn off video" button click away. That's great for me, because I like to face palm a lot, there's something liberating about the act of reenacting a meme, like a performance just for yourself.

Now I have this new, amazing face-palm-power at my disposal, yet I don't use it as much as I expected. In my perception we are much better at scheduling & conducting good meetings than in the before times. In particular the preparation & information sharing before the meeting has improved greatly - I don't recall the last meeting without an agenda. I do recall many in the before times.

## Working on your own at home is hard

We all expected problems. 

First went through the honeymoon period of remote work: giddily enjoying no-pants-meetings, getting more rest from sleeping in instead of commuting and feeling half-guilty-half-happy about skipping shower and makeup/grooming yet another day ("I'll do it tomorrow, I promise" I lie to myself...). 

Now some very real and unexpected problems have caught up with us. How's your back today? At the end of every day my lumbar spine feels like a dried up earthworm, scorched by the mid-summer sun. Barely anybody has a desk, chair and monitor setup that is meant for a full day of work (avid video gamers seem no be the rare exception). It's an easy problem we can solve with money - but only in some cases. Many have chosen an apartment or house that does not have the space for a proper work setup - that's just a reality of Tokyo real estate. If I had to chose between a living room sofa and a desk I'd go for the sofa 9 out of 8 times.

If you are a manager: how are the March timesheets of your reports? I've heard from several managers, some throw up their hands in despair "How did this guy work 20 hours in a single day?!". People seem to are work more hours at home than in the office, or at least they log more hours. If you ask [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Do-remote-workers-work-longer-hours) you get a similar answer: When people start with remote work they often work longer hours. The main driver is a lack of structure, which allows work hours to expand into other parts of life. The [2019 State of Remote Work](https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2019#) survey supports this, "unplugging after work" was the biggest struggle for remote workers.

{{< figure src="https://static.buffer.com/marketing/public/img/pages/state-of-remote/biggest-stuggle-working-remotely-2019.png" width="80%" >}}

In the remote work environment it is a lot harder for managers to protect their team from self-inflicted overwork. It's hard to know if people are taking the time to rest. In a recent ZOOM nomikai on a Friday night one of my team members frowned and said "I have to jump into this meeting..." only to get a rebuke from his manager. And rightfully so - the issue was not urgent, most probably not even important. He didn't attend that meeting. Nobody died, no one got hurt, no money was lost. Now how do we protect that person from that self destructive behavior? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Communication = Good Writing

We realized this before. In collaborating with offices in India, USA and France - ad hoc meetings don't cut it. A mind map on a confluence page doesn't communicate requirements. A meeting without follow up communications/documents might as well not have happened at all - as far as outcomes are concerned. So we knew all this, we just did not apply it to our work within the Tokyo office, or at least to varying and very limited degree. As a result teams we tried to loosely couple teams in different geographies, along service or activity boundaries. Well defined, documented interfaces always worked better between offices. Integrating a well documented service is reasonable, no matter the geography of the developing team. A team that focuses on QA execution & automation or security audits - that works reasonably well. On the other end of the spectrum: A service that requires multiple meetings just to understand the onboarding process only works if we are in the same office. A service team with developers spread out across 4 different offices - that falls apart real quick without written communication. That's what we knew before the pandemic.

Cut to the now - teams have more or less as many offices as they have team members. Synchronous meetings are possible, but not really effective for most activities. ad hoc meetings are much less frequent, even though they are easier now that they don't require finding a room or free space anymore. Small teams (say 2 pizzas) still work pretty well, they communicate constantly throughout the day on slack/teams/viber. On bigger teams a most of the ad hoc conversations -- in the hallway, on the way to get a coffee -- don't happen anymore. Requirements remain unclear, plans are not shared, expectations don't align. The only solution is to **write it down**. If you can't write it down you don't understand what you are trying to say - so forcing yourself to write it down will not just help the team, it will help you!

However that is a weak spot in our organizational skillset and not part of the culture. Good written communication is necessary and recognized by tech teams and managers, for example it's a key part in how I argued my way into E ranks. With a handful of high quality, highly technical documents you wrote it is easy to argue that you are an expert. Yet we don't foster that skill enough. Large portions of Rakuten Tech are unable to write technical documentation that's usable by other teams, or to write requirements documents that communicate who wants what and why to the developers. Jeff Bezos told his employees in 2002 that every team will expose their functionality and data as a service. In product quality[^3].

Rakuten Tech would not be able to do this now. Our technical writing literacy is just not there yet (to be fair: Amazon's skills were probably not there in 2002 as well). 

With roughly 100% remote work in Rakuten Tech at the moment we really need to improve.

## Presence != Control

Rakuten is a large company with very diverse teams and cultures. In my time here I have been in 3 different departments (ignoring reorganizations), one more traditionally Japanese, one very much shaped cash-cow-e-commerce mindset and one more western and innovation oriented. I have been exposed to different management theories/philosophies and have heard the same from many coworkers in other departments. 

Broadly I see 2 schools of thought: First the [scientific management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management) people, who believe that tight control, checking in regularly and physical presence are necessary for high productivity (= a nice way of saying "don't trust employees"). The theory goes back to the industrial age when production was monotonous (humans were only necessary because we didn't have the technology to automate those tasks) and micro-management really improved productivity of a factory. The second is [servant leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) which focuses on the empowerment of the team members in order to perform with maximum effectiveness and efficiency. This approach is less about control and more about enablement, managers check in to ask how they can resolve problems for the team, not to constantly get status reports from individuals. I have worked under both types of management regime and in my experience scientific management is really outdated in times of creative knowledge work[^4]. But there are still seem to be many followers of it unfortunately.

[^4]: Thankfully I work in a pocket of servant leadership these days and I advocate for it in all the teams that I am involved in or support.

This manifests itself in some managers requiring their teams be on a ZOOM call all day long - just so the managers can see them. This is so dystopian that it's not even funny anymore. Other companies do similar things[^5].

{{< figure src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EWSwqEAUMAAJ4X9?format=png" width="60%" >}}

This is all very sad, the only upside is that I hear about it less and less, managers seem to come around (or teams don't complain about it anymore...). Most of us already knew that presence is not control and we are getting over that old cognitive illusion, one pandemic at a time.

## Where do we go from here?

So we have learned (some of us are maybe still learning) that...

* We are just as effective working remotely, even if we work on a slightly different schedule. 
* We never needed all those meetings - good riddance I say!
* We really need a decent home office space
* Our writing skills need to improve (...hello blogging...)
* Presence only gave us the illusion of control. Let's grow up and become real managers!
