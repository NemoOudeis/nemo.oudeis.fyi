So I shut them down. 
No more banners, no more app badges, no more sounds, no more jumping dock telling me that IM, email, calendar, ... well no one interrupts me anymore - unless I chose to.
The payoff after one day: although I didn't code (I am on a loaner PC for a couple of days, no point in setting up all the dev tools) it felt like a productive day. I wrote properly worded emails, a report, did code review for 3 pull requests, drafted a suggestion on how to improve our documentation and helped out some engineers by setting up a training for them. At the end of the day I felt a sense of accomplishment, I felt refreshed and ready to take on something new. On a **Monday**. For the first time this year.

...but wait... all other mondays sucked...

Let's take a few steps back: Recently I've been thinking a lot about the mental condition of engineers, how work makes us happy and unhappy and why. The creative side of software engineering is so rewarding, after a couple of hours flow, be it designing, coding, refactoring, reviewing etc. I feel awesome. I feel like I just rocked the world with my engineering genius - even if it's just a tiny [git precommit hook that formats java code](https://github.com/rakutentech/android-buildconfig/pull/47) (and never creates conflicts ðŸ˜ƒ).

On the other hand doing a lot of the menial work that big corp team work requires feels draining. Reacting to tons of emails, comments on issue trackers, inquiries in the support portal, scheduling meetings, reading HR manuals, navigating the 20 odd floor of the office building in search for a meeting room, where I'll spend 30-60 minutes with 6 other people, but only pay attention to 7 minutes of the whole afair. After a day chopped up by these disruptions I feel fucked. I feel like the energy was sucked out of me, right alongside a part of my soul. Even if it was bonus day.

While thinking about these things I came back to the [Basecamp Employee Handbook](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook), which describes an company that strives to enable employees to have more happy-flow type days and less soul-sucking-corporation days. What strikes me most is the generousity with which Basecamp approaches the employee-employer relationship. Many companies in tech try to fashion themselves as great places to wrok with free food, beer, soda, casual drinking on fridays in the office and group activities. So does mine, but the crucial mistake is that they only assemlbe the ingredients (free meals, office with gym, hairdresser, dry cleaning, massage studio, cafe and convenience store) but don't cook it up into a great meal (metaphor borrowed from [@DHH](https://twitter.com/dhh)). But that is not genuine, people are expected to work pointless overtime (in parts of the company), the open office is really just a way to pack workers as densly as possible, hiring procedures reflect a disinterest in the people. It's just checking off boxes on the "how to be a cool tech employer" checklist, without any conviction.

In the [Basecamp Employee Handbook](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook) I found that they produce the [Rework Podcast](https://rework.fm/) which I started listening to. There is great stuff in there and most importantly it genuinely feels like the people I hear an that show actually live and work by their handbook... actually not quite, it seems like the handbook is an expression of their work & life philosophy. Which excites me. Shortly after I watched Jason Frieds TED talk on "Why work doesn't happen at work"

Drawing some inspriation from his words I will log the number of scheduled meetings vs attended meetings vs meetings in which I am distracted. Moreover I will note down all the interruptions during the day (or at least try). I started today and the pure awareness of interruptions made me silence all the communication tools, turning them from communication that is pushed into my face into something I actively seek out. Pull >> Push. This has made for the most conscious Monday this year, I'm curious how the rest of the week turns out. Have you tried turning off all interruptions (in your control) at work?
