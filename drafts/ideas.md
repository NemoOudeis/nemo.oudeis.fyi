I feel most productive at work when I…
* …am able take ownership of my work
* …am challenged but not overwhelmed by my work
* …feel like other people regard me as important for that work
* …feel like other people recognize my contribution
* …feel sufficiently rewarded for my efforts
* …learn new things as part of my work
* …feel like my work matters, i.e. it has an effect on somebody's life
* …feel my work is in sync with my personal and the organizations values

I feel most worthless at work when I…
* …have to participate in communications that I have nothing to add to
* …feel like my opinion is not heard
* …feel like my efforts were in vain
* …feel like the organizations values are at conflict with my personal values
