		<p>Some weeks are shit. I mean really shit. Come into work Monday, starting with a mindless morning meeting, all the way through a day chopped up by more meaningless meetings, annoyning emails and a constant stream of instant messanging interruptions. At the end of such a day I feel like I got nothing done, nothing worth working for at least. And it's rinse and repeat from there, the whole week. üòµ</p>
<p>In weeks like that I lose confidence, I struggle to start working on that important project because it seems too difficult. The fear of failure amplifies, there is no excitement of discovery. Anxiety stifles productivity, work satisfaction and even life outside of work. Some people try to &ldquo;take the edge off&rdquo; with alcohol and cigarettes - the old fashioned way - escaping that reality for just a little bit. It never helps.</p>
<p>As software engineers we work with our minds, our emotions disrupt the mind or propel it to unknown heights. But we rarely talk about that. There is a few so called &ldquo;soft talks&rdquo; at tech conferences, for example I heard <a href="https://twitter.com/AnastasiaLopezD">Anastasia L√≥pez</a> talk about &ldquo;Authentic Developers&rdquo; earlier this year in which she openly spoke about the shame and fear we experience as part of work a well as the anxiety of imposter syndrome. It was a great talk, go check it out below. (She will also <a href="https://twitter.com/skillsmatter/status/1050974614967513089">speak about hiring at DroidCon UK</a> next week and wrote about <a href="https://devblog.songkick.com/lets-make-the-android-community-better-b219aab0a0a9">the importance of soft talks</a>)</p>

<p>Anastasia is a notable exception in the Android developer community (which is where I hang out most), she starts the conversation about mental health without clich√® or stigma, I'm glad we have her üëè.</p>
<p>I want to participate in that conversation, so I've been thinking about factors that contribute to mental stability and joy at work and came up with this non exhaustive list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ownership &amp; Impact</li>
<li>External recognition &amp; reward</li>
<li>Growth</li>
<li>Personal Performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's dive into it!</p>
<h2 id="ownership--impact">Ownership &amp; Impact</h2>
<p>For me the most obvious factor is ownership: I want to build products that help people achieve their goals better, easier, faster or cheaper. When I see a lack of quality in the documentation or a bug in its behavior or a lacking feature I want to fix it. If the product owner ignores my opinion solely based on the fact that I am engineer and she is the PO I cannot own the product. But if the PO rejects my opinion for reasons and explains the rationale that's a different story, healthy dialog is part of any team process. Conversely if I, as an engineer, come up with 2 different approaches to fix a bug that change the product behavior in different significant ways it is up to me to explain that to the PO (and the rest of the team), hear her input and reach a conclusion together. Or else I'm preventing her from taking ownership of the product.</p>
<p>The point I want to make is that the structure of an organization should not pidgeon-hole people in roles that foster dictatorship within the respective pidgeon-hole power silos. In order to create a team that takes ownership of a product we need healthy discussion, disagreement and conflict resolution within the team.</p>
<p><strong>Allow teams to own their work!</strong></p>
<p>I have seen 2 ways to systematically prevent teams from taking ownership, you could call them organizational anti-patterns. I'm sharing them as cautionary tale for those who are slowly slipping into those patterns and to help others that are experiencing them (knowingly or unknowingly) - you are not alone &amp; it doesn't have to stay like this!</p>
<h3 id="dont-1-divide-the-engineering-team">DON'T #1: Divide the Engineering Team</h3>
<p>An example of making people work on something without allowing them to take ownership is the industrial age factory: A floor manager that understands how the different parts of the factory come together to, or at least has a basic understanding, directs and controls individuals that work on a single, isolated, repetitive tasks. The line worker has no ownership, they likely don't care much for what they do and struggle to find satisfaction purely from the work they are doing, they would escape work like the plague if they didn't need the money - what Marx called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation">alienation from the act of production</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I've seen similar realities in software engineering (this is not a general statement, it is purely based on my working experience, so take it as anecdotal evidence), especially in outsourcing to off shore development centers. There is a stark contrast between here (the floor manager) and there (the line worker). The off shore team adapts by focusing only on the task at hand, investing minimum effort to &ldquo;solving it&rdquo; without considering the whole product, because the inhouse team shares none of the ownership. That cultivates a culture of tribalism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups">ingroup vs outgroup</a> with a toxic cycle of one side blaming the other. As you can imagine that didn't work out. Both sides were frustrated, motivation suffered and work felt uncomfortable, unrewarding, every day at work was slowly eating away at me and I needed to actively recover after work from that mental stress. After a lot of back and forth with management I rotated out of that team, it was something I couldn't &ldquo;fix&rdquo; alone and there was no support from the team &amp; MGMT.  It felt like I burned some bridges there. But at the time it was either that or leaving the company.</p>
<p>But then almost the same thing happened to me later that same year on a different project with different people that same year üòî. That time we worked hard to unlearn the bad culture and become a real team - regardless of location &amp; employeer - with moderate success accumulating slowly. Culture doesn't change overnight. The team &amp; MGMT recognized the importance of a product team where every individual takes ownership.</p>
<h3 id="dont-2-divide-the-product-team">DON'T #2: Divide the Product Team</h3>
<p>Another demotivating but apparently common situation (again based on personal experience, take it as anecdotal evidence) is when the group of people working on a product is divided into a business and a development side. I have worked in situations where the business side sees the development side pure executors, who should build exactly what the business side wants. Communication is one way: biz tells dev what to do - end of story. After all the business side generates all the money, right? Well&hellip;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;product owner&rdquo; on the dev team is the only one who ever gets to speak to the business side, she relays their communication to the rest of the dev team. Obviously that PO has no ownership of the product, neither does the rest of the development team, because all the decisions are made on the business side. Ironically the business side couldn't truely own the product neither, because they were unable to make reliable product decisions, some features were impossible or the development team delayed (sabotaged?) them.
Same story as before: tribal behavior, dev blaming biz, biz blaming dev, a stagnating product that was burning money. Classic lose-lose situation. üòû</p>
